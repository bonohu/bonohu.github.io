Last summer, our work on the use of FANTOM5 data was published in Scientific Data.

> [RefEx, a reference gene expression dataset as a web tool for the functional analysis of genes](http://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.105)

This article was included in [FANTOM5 collection](https://www.nature.com/collections/fantom5). It was a great pleasure to be published together with FANTOM5 data descriptors for us.

Interview on this collection including our RefEx was then opened to Japanese biologists originally in Japanese at Consortium of Biological Sciences (ConBio2017) held in Kobe, December 2017. And, now in English!

I am very pleased to see also in English!
