Last summer, our work on the use of FANTOM5 data was published in Scientific Data. 

> [RefEx, a reference gene expression dataset as a web tool for the functional analysis of genes](http://doi.org/10.1038/sdata.2017.105)

This article was included in [FANTOM5 collection](https://www.nature.com/collections/fantom5).
Interview on this collection including our RefEx was published originally in Japanese. And, now in English!

I am very pleased to see also in English!
