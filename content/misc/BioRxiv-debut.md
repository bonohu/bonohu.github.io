Paper for collaboration with Dr. Tanimoto at Hiroshima University in Japan was published in PLOS ONE.

> [Differentiated Embryo Chondrocyte plays a crucial role in DNA damage response via transcriptional regulation under hypoxic conditions](http://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0192136)

This study contained my work on the collective intelligence of hypoxic transcriptome from public gene expression database (NCB Gene Expression Omnibus). We could not publish this kind of work to regular journals because there were no new data in our work to be published.

Recent years, the re-use of such data in public databases becomes a key issue in life science and researchers get to ask me the way how to make these lists. So I decided to publish that work in BioRxiv and did so the day before yesterday. There was a screening for submitted paper and it took two days to be published in BioRxiv.

This was my first trial to upload my work in the preprint server.
