## Why blog in English
I have continuously updated my blog in Japanese which was hosted in my server at home. The server was broken early this month, and I thought how to resume that.

I published a book for biological data analysis in Japanese which was a clean summary of my blog in Japanese. I start writing new contents in English because most of main contents resides in the book and I want to have blog readers from all over the world who cannot see Japanese.

That's why I start blogging in English :)
