Joined [SPARQLthon](http://wiki.lifesciencedb.jp/mw/SPARQLthon) for Jan 2018 was held at DBCLS Kashiwa. This was 64th  [SPARQLthon](http://wiki.lifesciencedb.jp/mw/SPARQLthon64).

I will hack for the development of [AOE](http://aoe.dbcls.jp), index of public omics (gene expression) data.

## SPARQLthon64 day2

Tackling to hack parsers for inputing metadata from [NCBI GEO](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) utilizing DBCLS SRA API.
Thanks to this API, we have no need to download whole GEO data where it was needed when the GEO index was maintained in DBCLS.
